    <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
    <h2>What is a Browser?</h2>
    <p>A graphical user interface used to help a typical user of the internet explore the world wide web. A browser can display HTML Files  which shows the text, pictures, music, and videos.</p>
    <h2>The Start of the Internet Browser</h2>
    <p>In 1993 the world wide web was new unexplored territory for many computer scientists and programmers alike with limitless possibilities. One of the first to pioneer and map out this territory would be Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape Navigator.  Through his browser, he had a vision that anyone could access the world wide web at their leisure. At this time, the only people using the world wide web were experienced computer users and large businesses, and its design was not very user friendly. Through this new browser, a user could upload images and point and click onto various links to help traverse the world wide web. The first browser to be made by  Marc Andreessen and his colleges was Mosaic in 1993. Mosaic was introduced to only 12 users initially, but its appealing interface and design helped gather more followers exceptionally quickly. Jim Clark, a co-founder of Netscape, saw the potential in Marc Andreessen’s browser and found a way to turn it into a business venture.</p>
    <h2>Microsoft’s Opposition</h2>
    <p>With Mosaic's growing success, it gathered a lot of attention from various tech companies, including the leading champion of the time, Microsoft.  Similarly, to the Mosaic founders, Microsoft was founded on a few smart college students lead by Bill Gates. By using innovative strategies and techniques, Microsoft could usurp all the competitors such as Lotus, Novel, and IBM and gained total control over the tech industry. So, it came to no surprise that Bill Gates saw the potential threat to his enterprise, and he saw another group of people doing a similar thing with web browsers. With Netscape's launch, Microsoft soon had fears that this browser could later gain control over the software platform, a vital tool towards the development of new technologies.</p>
    <h2>The Battle for the Internet</h2>
    <p>At the time of its success, the Netscape people were not fully aware of the threat that Microsoft was and the power it held in the tech industry. Eventually, Microsoft conducted a meeting with Netscape to discuss buying their browser for their own, offering 1 million dollars in exchange. However, Marc Andreessen and people at Netscape knew that this browser's value would be worth a lot more and declined on their offer. Their anti-trust lawyer Gary Reback told them that reporting Microsoft to the United States Government to break the Anti-Trust law set themselves up for a lawsuit.  Once Netscape had gone public, its value in the stock immediately increased, gaining its initial value ten times by the end of the first day.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft had created a web browser of its own:  Internet Explorer. With Microsoft’s team of expert coders, better financial budget, and without having to limit sales just to personal computers, Internet Explorer would soon out-compete Netscape Navigator. The final nail in the coffin would be that Internet Explorer came free with the software, something that Netscape could not do as well, thus ultimately leading to their failure.  </p>
    <h1>The Aftermath of the War</h1>
    <p>Although Microsoft’s had success with Internet Explorer, thanks to Netscape’s great initial start, many of the founders and workers of Netscape were able to earn quite a lot of money through its stocks. However, the battle would not be over for Microsoft as the Supreme Court had now summoned it for its Anti-Trust Lawsuit. The court accused Microsoft of using its wealth and power to act in predatory ways towards smaller businesses, with its most notable victim Netscape Navigator.  Bill Gates was forced to take a videotaped deposition and later found guilty on the charges. Gates had to hand over his position as CEO of Microsoft to Steve Balmer. Eventually, other companies such as Google soon out-competed Microsoft’s browser engine with their browsers. Though Microsoft still holds a large part of world tech today, it has now clearly lost much of its initial boldness in its golden era. </p>
