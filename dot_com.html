            <h2>The Age of E-Commerce </h2>
            <p>In the late 1990s, in a small-town garage in Seattle, a man named Jeff Bezos realized one of the most popular selling items on the internet was books. In 1995 Bezos would launch Amazon to become the most extensive online bookstore. At the same time, another company was about to make its debut, eBay. Pierre Omidyar, eBay’s founder, though at the time that an online auction site would be useful to many people. Omidyar believed that an online auction site would more fair then and level than other markets. Within months eBay was gaining hundreds of dollars through fees, and Amazon was quickly gaining more and more users in a short period. This growth did not go undetected as various wall-street executives saw the world wide web's immediate increase in only four years.</p>
            <h2>Moore’s and Metcalfe’s Laws</h2>
            <p>The reasons for this rapid growth in website user was not only because of an appealing website. Because of Moore’s Law, the sped and power of integrated circus double with every passing year, allowing machines to become more compact and efficient over time.  There was also Metcalfe’s Law, which states that the value of the network grows more and more rapidly for every new node.</p>
            <h2>The Bubble </h2>
            <p>With the sudden popularity of the world wide web and the success of certain websites such as Amazon and eBay, many investors s soon saw the appeal of the internet. Bezos had an innovative strategy to continue gaining more customers within a short time, which he liked to call “Get, Big, Fast.” To achieve his customer's trust, we sell his products at a reduced price for widespread appeal. Then he used a new system of encryption created by a group of mathematicians, which allowed Amazon to safely collect the user's credit card numbers to exchange business. With these factors combined, analysts determined that the value of Amazon’s stock value would rise to the 300-dollar price range.  With the public opening of Amazon, not only was it able to double its worth, but it was able to do so within weeks. Buying frenzy immediately came afterward as now investors wanted to grab to their slice of the internet pie, throwing money at any. Day traders did nothing to alleviate this out of control spending, as most were nonprofessional workers, gaining most of their information through chat rooms on the web.  Very few of the dot coms present to investors generate a significant amount of revenue, but investors did not care because they knew that so long was one able to become successful; everything would work out.
            <h2>The Crash and Aftermath</h2>
            <p>In April 2000, the Federal Reserve realized that the market was close to overheating due to this dot com bubble. That’s why NASDAQ quickly fell by 355 points labeling the infamous day, black Friday.  Most of the created websites during the dot-com bubble soon went under, and many people were pointing fingers as to who blame. In the end, the dot com bubble would serve as another example as to how new technology combines with reckless spending can only lead to disaster. Still, there would some permanent benefits from the bubble. Though most failed some site was able to gain some stable footing, and the craze for fiber optics helped improve internet speed immensely. Although these improvements would occur eventually, it was thanks to the Bubble that the process would take five years instead of 15</p>
