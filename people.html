    <h1>Internet and People </h1>
    <h2>Start of Social Media</h2>
    <p>Nothing holds a more important part of the worldwide web than communication. Through communication on the internet, people can share ideas, data, philosophy, and ideologies quickly. The web was especially appealing since not a single entity had total control over it.  Two primary web services that emphasize these ideas is Digg, a social news-sharing site, and YouTube, a video sharing service.  YouTube challenged the traditional media companies with large budget shows and limited access, and made it so any person could do anything they want and post it on to their platform.  Digg does a similar thing where rather than learning towards a particular demographic like most newsgroups, the information that’s shared is decided by the people. It was theorized by many that people like to see their own faces and have their voices heard on the web on the internet. Facebook would embrace all these ideals to become the largest social networking site on the internet, gaining millions of dollars through revenue and shares</p>
    <h2>Napster</h2>
    <p>In the early 1990’s the popularity of downloading music online was steadily growing as MP3 allowed music files to be compressed and transferable to users. Then came Napster, a music sharing program, and one of the first social media sites. By allowing users to share their music with other users, if one person had files of the music you were interested in, you could find it on Napster. Many teenagers and young adults found this excellent as it avoids paying for music CDs. It also showed each user's taste and preference for music, eventually creating a web community. However, because the music could be downloaded for free, it presented some legal issues for Napster.  Ultimately, the record industry stepped and filed for a case against Napster with ended with the site being shut down. Later would come iTunes to fill in Napster’s spot, this time working under copyright protection. Still, file sharing sites continued to emerge the web as well, thus never genuinely putting the issue to rest once and for all.</p>
    <h2>Web 2.0</h2>
    <p>Web 2.0 is the newfound change in the worldwide web’s structure and interactive process. People can contribute content to interact with each other on the internet.  One early example of this would be Myspace, who emulated from Napster in its community of people and attracted a variety of people. From casual users to music bands to corporations, everyone seemed to be part of Myspace at its heyday. Unfortunately, it would later be taken over by Facebook with the passing years making it difficult for MySpace remain relevant.</p>
